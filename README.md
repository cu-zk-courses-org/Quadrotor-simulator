This quadrotor simulator is build in MATLAB&Simulink upon the foundation of another fixed wing simulator stored in repository https://github.com/stan-lu/Fixed-wing-simulator. It also makes use of the skeleton code provided by [1]. The official template files is stored at https://github.com/randybeard/mavsim_template_files. When I build this repo only the MATLAB&Simulink files were provided and now seems like it supports Python as well.I modified it to achieve the goal of performing cooperative monitoring formation, of which the code cannot be provided because a patent about it is under review by now.
